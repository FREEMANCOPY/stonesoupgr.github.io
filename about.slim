    |Stone Soup is a cooperative office in the center of Athens, bringing together people from various industries, all eager to learn, build and ship. Residents come from around the corner - or straight from the airport - in order to convert their hard work and know-how into a variety of shipping products.

    |Under the Stone Soup roof developers, designers, illustrators, movie-makers, photographers, marketeers, and business experts come together, work on projects, and educate each other. We have seen many projects come to life, teams being forged and relationships sprout between people from all over world. We believe there is no better way to achieve this but bringing people together, and then, wait for the soup to start cooking.
