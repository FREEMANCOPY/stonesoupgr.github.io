In October we invited the guys of [CityShare](http://cityshare.com 'Saving and sharing tips is now crazy simple') to come over to Athens to build the MVP of their App.

We set up a project space, recruited the team they needed to build the App and arranged food, lodging and a trip to the beach.

In 2 weeks we went from 0 to MVP and sent the guys back home with a working MVP, a clean code base and a maintained issue tracker.

[Siemen Sikkema](https://twitter.com/Kuikentje 'Siemen Sikkema on Twitter'), developer at the [Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/index 'The Big Nerd Ranch'), wrote [a blog post](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/4349-greek-pressure-cooker 'The Greek Pressure Cooker') about it.

We all feel it was a great success and we can't wait for the next project to come over and step into the [Greek Pressure Cooker](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/4349-greek-pressure-cooker 'The Greek Pressure Cooker').
