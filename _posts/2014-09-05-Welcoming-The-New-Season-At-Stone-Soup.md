We are excited to be back and on full speed after the relaxing summer months. We have a lot of things coming up, projects, workshops and interesting people visiting us from The Netherlands and the US. 

First in line, we are happy to welcome back Martinus Meiborg from Amsterdam, founder of Camerize, who is coming for a second round of development. 

More TBA soon!
