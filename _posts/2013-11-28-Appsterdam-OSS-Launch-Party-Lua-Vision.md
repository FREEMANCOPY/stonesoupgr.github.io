Stone Soup is hosting the first [Appsterdam] OSS Launch Party.

On Thursday December 5th, [Giannis Gravezas] will present his [Lua Vision] project followed by a hands-on workshop where you can play with the software.

[Lua Vision] is a [Lua] module which allows you read from the MS [Kinect]. This session is aimed at developers, artists and academics.

We will provide some drink and snacks, donations can made to [Appsterdam] to share in the costs.

For more information see the [Appsterdam event page] and the [Facebook event page].
