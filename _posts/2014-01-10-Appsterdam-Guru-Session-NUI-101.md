On Saturday, January 10th we hosted the second Appsterdam Greece Guru Session.

Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops by the community for the community.

During the day [Yannis Gravezas] introduced participants to the basics of computer vision and NUI development using the MS Kinect.

At the end of the session everybody had written his/her own visual application for hand tracking from scratch and learnt all about the jargon and the mechanics of computer vision.

We will be hosting the next session soon, so keep an eye on [Facebook] and [Twitter].
