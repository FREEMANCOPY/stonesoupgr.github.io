Today Camerize had a great day with the Paladin team at their NAB booth. The Camerize app was demonstrated several times. It worked flawlessly with the Paladin streaming box running Wirecast and it blew everybody away, for the UI as well as for its connectivity. Camerize has found an ally to reach out to Wirecast users!
