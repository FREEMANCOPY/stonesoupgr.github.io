On Saturday, December 14th we hosted the first Appsterdam Greece Guru Session.

Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops by the community for the community.

During the day 4 Gurus from [SC!FY] took the participants on a journey through Machine Learing.  
At the end of the session everybody had created a spam filter and had enough bagage to continue hacking on the topic back home. 

And in good Stone Soup tradition, we had a great hangout and discussion after the session.

We will be hosting the next session soon, so keep an eye on [Facebook] and [Twitter].
