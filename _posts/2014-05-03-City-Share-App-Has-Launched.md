Last October the guys of <a href="http://cityshare.com/" target="_blank">CityShare</a> came over to Athens to work on their App for two intense weeks here at Stone Soup. We are happy to see they have launched their App in the Dutch App Store and are preparing for world domination.

Good luck to Maarten, Flip and the rest of the team. And hope the guys will grace us with their presence again sometime soon.

If you also like to build your App in the Greek Pressure Cooker, contact us.
