Monday night we gathered at Stone Soup for some iBeacon hacking.

Hack nights are informal, very hands-on open sessions for people interested in a particualr niche technology.

During the night [Klaas Speller] introduced participants to the basics of iBeacons and concepts and then everyone played with the technology.

One of the products of the evening was a simple but useful server to store and retrieve info about specific iBeacons. You can find the [repository here](https://github.com/StoneSoupGr/ibeacon-store) and you can find that nights [Hackpad here](https://hackpad.com/iBeacon-Hackathon-vQlQmTYVZwy).

We will be hosting next sessions soon, so keep an eye on [Facebook] and [Twitter].
